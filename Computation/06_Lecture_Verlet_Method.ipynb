    "# Verlet Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Verlet algorithm is a widely used numerical method for integrating Newton’s equations of motion, particularly in systems where energy conservation and long-term stability are crucial, such as molecular dynamics and celestial mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the standard Euler method, which is first-order and accumulates significant error over time, the Verlet algorithm is a second-order, time-reversible, and *symplectic* integrator. These properties make it particularly well-suited for solving problems where phase-space structure and energy conservation are essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common form, the **position Verlet algorithm**, updates the positions and velocities:\n",
    "$$r(t+\\Delta t) = r(t) + v(t)\\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}a(t)\\Delta t^2$$\n",
    "$$v(t+\\Delta t) = v(t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(a(t)+a(t+\\Delta t)\\right)\\Delta t$$\n",
    "where $r(t), v(t), a(t)$ are the position, velocity, and acceleration at time $t$. The acceleration is derived from the forces acting on the system. You can derive theVerlet-Strömer form by considering a forward and backward Taylor expansion:\n",
    "$$ x(t+dt) = x(t)+v(t)dt+\\frac{1}{2}a(t) dt^2$$\n",
    "$$ x(t-dt) = x(t)-v(t)dt+\\frac{1}{2}a(t) dt^2$$\n",
    "$$ x(t+dt) + x(t-dt) = 2x(t) + a(t) dt^2$$\n",
    "Discretizing the relationship to $$x_{n+1} = 2x_n - x_{n-1} + a_n \\Delta t^2$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The Verlet algorithm is particularly effective in Hamiltonian systems where symplectic integration is desired to maintain the geometric properties of phase space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    " - Time-reversible\n",
    " - Energy-conserving\n",
    " - Memory-saving\n",
    " - Second-order accuracy\n",
    "   \n",
    "The Verlet algorithm is particularly well-suited for simulating conservative systems because it is time-reversible, meaning that integrating forward and then backward returns the system to its original state, preserving phase-space structure. It also exhibits good energy conservation properties, as while small fluctuations in energy may occur, they remain bounded over long timescales, preventing the unphysical energy drift that plagues simpler methods like Euler’s method. Additionally, the algorithm does not require explicit velocity storage, which reduces memory demands in large-scale simulations. With its second-order accuracy, the Verlet algorithm achieves significantly better precision than first-order methods, making it a powerful tool for long-term numerical integration in classical mechanics and molecular dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variants\n",
    "- Velocity Verlet: Explicitly includes velocity calculations.\n",
    "- Leapfrog Verlet: Updates velocities at half-time steps, enhancing numerical efficiency in certain applications.\n",
    "- Beeman’s Algorithm: A higher-accuracy variant that improves velocity estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Velocity Verlet\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color: white;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"figures/velocityverlet.png\" alt=\"Image description\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "The Velocity Verlet algorithm is an improved version of the basic Verlet method that explicitly includes velocity calculations. It is commonly used in molecular dynamics and physics simulations because it is symplectic and second-order accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm computes a new position given the previous one: $$x_{n+1} = x_n + v_n \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}a_n \\Delta t^2$$\n",
    "The new acceleration is computed at the new position: $$a_{n+1} = \\frac{F_{n+1}}{m}.$$\n",
    "Then, a new velocity is found: $$v_{n+1} = v_n + \\frac{1}{2}(a_n+a_{n+1})\\Delta t.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This method eliminates the need to store multiple previous positions and provides an explicit velocity value at very point. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Leapfrog Algorithm\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color: white;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"figures/leapfrog.gif\" alt=\"Image description\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "The Leapfrog algorithm is another varian of verlet integration that staggers velocity and position updates, leading to a good numerical stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leapfrog updates the velocity by half-steps: $$v_{n+1/2} = v_n + \\frac{1}{2}a_n \\Delta t$$\n",
    "and then updates the position using the half-step velocity: $$x_{n+1} = x_n + v_{n+1/2}\\Delta t.$$\n",
    "It then computes the new acceleration at the new position: $$a_{n+1} = F_{n+1}/m$$\n",
    "Finally, it updates the velocity to the full step: $v_{n+1} = v_{n+1/2} + \\frac{1}{2}a_{n+1}\\Delta t.$\n",
    "\n",
    "This method remains symplectic and second-order accurate. In many cases, it leads to long-term stability in Hamiltonian systems. Unfortunately, velocities are staggered in time, which can be inconvenient in some applications."

    "\n",
    "Beeman's method is a numerical integration algorithm for second-order ODEs of the form $\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = \\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{r})$, belonging to the same family as the Verlet algorithm. It was introduced by D. Beeman in 1976 in the context of molecular dynamics simulations, where computing velocities accurately is critical for estimating thermodynamic quantities such as temperature and pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the standard Verlet position update, obtained by adding the forward and backward Taylor expansions of $\\mathbf{r}(t \\pm \\Delta t)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{r}(t + \\Delta t) = 2\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(t - \\Delta t) + \\mathbf{a}(t)\\,\\Delta t^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^4)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This update is fourth-order accurate in position, but velocities must be recovered by finite differencing over two time levels, giving only second-order accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{v}(t) = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}(t + \\Delta t) - \\mathbf{r}(t - \\Delta t)}{2\\,\\Delta t} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Velocity Verlet algorithm improves on this by making positions and velocities explicit and synchronous, but its velocity update still carries a truncation error of $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)$:\n",

    "\n",
    "Beeman's method achieves a higher-order velocity estimate by incorporating the acceleration from the *previous* timestep, $\\mathbf{a}(t - \\Delta t)$, effectively fitting a quadratic through three acceleration values and integrating it over the interval $[t,\\, t + \\Delta t]$. The resulting update equations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{r}(t + \\Delta t) = \\mathbf{r}(t) + \\mathbf{v}(t)\\,\\Delta t + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{6}\\left[4\\,\\mathbf{a}(t) - \\mathbf{a}(t - \\Delta t)\\right]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The position update is equivalent to Velocity Verlet to the same order, both achieve $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^4)$ accuracy in position. The critical difference is the velocity update, which is now $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)$, one order better. The coefficients $(2, 5, -1)/6$ come directly from integrating the quadratic interpolant of the acceleration, and can be verified by Taylor-expanding both sides.\n",

    "All methods in the table require a single force evaluation per step after startup, so Beeman carries no additional computational cost compared to Velocity Verlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The bootstrap problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the update equations require $\\mathbf{a}(t - \\Delta t)$, Beeman's method is not self-starting. At the very first step, no previous acceleration exists. The standard remedy is to initialize $\\mathbf{a}(t - \\Delta t) = \\mathbf{a}(t_0)$, i.e. using the known acceleration at the initial position. This introduces a small startup error that decays over the first few steps, and can be further mitigated by running a single Velocity Verlet step to generate a consistent $\\mathbf{a}(t_0 + \\Delta t)$ before the main loop begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use Beeman's method\n",
    "\n",
    "The improved velocity accuracy matters most when physical observables depend directly on $\\mathbf{v}$ rather than $\\mathbf{r}$. In molecular dynamics, for example, kinetic temperature is proportional to $\\langle |\\mathbf{v}|^2 \\rangle$ and the virial pressure requires accurate instantaneous velocities; both benefit from the extra order of accuracy. For trajectory-focused problems such as orbital mechanics, Velocity Verlet or Leapfrog are generally preferable since they are symplectic: they exactly preserve a modified Hamiltonian, guaranteeing that conserved quantities like energy and angular momentum remain bounded indefinitely. Beeman does not share this property, and slowly drifting conserved quantities can accumulate over long integrations."
