    "# Kepler’s problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The motion of the sun and the earth is an example of a two-body problem. This is a relatively simple problem that can be solved analytically (it's interesting to notice here, however, that adding a new object to the problem, the moon for instance, make it completely intractable. This is the famous “three body problem”). We can assume that, to a good approximation, the sun is stationary and is a convenient origin of our coordinate system. This is equivalent to changing to a center of mass coordinate system, where most of the mass is concentrated in the sun. The problem can be reduced to an equivalent one body problem involving an object of reduced mass $\\mu$ given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu=\\frac{mM}{m+M}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the mass of the earth is $m=5.99\\times 10^{24}$ kg and the mass of the sun is $M=1.99\\times 10^{30}$ kg we find that for most practical purposes, the reduced mass of the earth-sun system is that of the earth. Hence, in the following we are going to consider the problem of a single particle of\n",
    "mass $m$ moving about a fixed center of force, which we take as the origin of the coordinate system. The gravitational force on the particle $m$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\mathbf F}=-\\frac{GMm}{r^3}{\\mathbf r},$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where the vector ${\\mathbf r}$ is directed from $M$ to $m$, and $G$ is the gravitation constant \n",
    "\n",
    "$$G=6.67\\times 10^{-11} \\frac{m^3}{kg.s^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The negative sign implies that the gravitational force is attractive, and decreases with the separation $r$. The gravitational force is a “central force”: its magnitude depends on the separation between the particles and its direction is along the line that connects them. Because gravitation is a central force, angular momentum is conserved. Since angular momentum is a vector quantity, we can restrict motion of a orbiting body to 2 dimensions, that is the $xy$ plane. The angular momentum ${\\mathbf L}$ lies on the third direction $z$ and is a constant of motion, <span>*i.e.*</span> it is conserved:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_z=({\\mathbf r}\\times m{\\mathbf v})_z=m(xv_y-yv_x)=\\mathrm{const.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional constant of motion is the total energy $E$ given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E=\\frac{1}{2}mv^2-\\frac{GmM}{r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we fix the coordinate system in the sun, the equation of motion is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m\\frac{d^2{\\mathbf r}}{dt^2}=-\\frac{mMG}{r^3}{\\mathbf r}$$ \n",
    "\n",

    "&& F_y=-\\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\sin{\\theta}=-\\frac{GMm}{r^3}y.\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "Hence, the equations of motions in cartesian coordinates are:\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "&& \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-\\frac{GM}{r^3}x, \\\\\n",
    "&& \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}=-\\frac{GM}{r^3}y, \\end{aligned}$$ \n",

    "where $r^2=x^2+y^2$. These are coupled differential equations, since each differential equation contains both $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circular motion \n",
    "\n",
    "Since many planetary orbits are nearly circular, it is useful to obtain the condition for a circular orbit. In this case, the magnitude of the acceleration ${\\mathbf a}$ is related to the radius by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a=\\frac{v^2}{r}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $v$ is the speed of the object. The acceleration is always directed toward the center. Hence\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{mv^2}{r}=\\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "$$v=\\left(\\frac{GM}{r}\\right)^{1/2}.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a general condition for the circular orbit. We can also find the dependence of the period $T$ on the radius of a circular orbit. Using the relation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$T=\\frac{2\\pi r}{v},$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "we obtain\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T^2=\\frac{4\\pi^2r^3}{GM}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elliptical orbits \n",
    "\n",
    "An ellipse has two foci $F_1$ and $F_2$, and has the property that for any point the distance $F_{1P}+F_{2P}$ is a constant. It also has a horizontal semi-axis $a$ and a vertical $b$. It is common in astronomy to characterize an orbit by its “eccentricity” $e$, given by the ratio of the distance between the foci, and the length of the major axis $2a$. Since $F_{1P}+F_{2P}=2a$, it is easy to show that (consider a point $P$ at $x=0$,$y=b$)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e=\\sqrt{1- \\frac{b^2}{a^2}},$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "with $0<e<1$. A special case is $a=b$ for which the ellipse reduces to a circle and $e=0$. The earth orbit has eccentricity $e=0.0167$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",

    "\n",
    "### Astronomical units \n",
    "It is useful to choose a system of units where the product $GM$ is of the order of unity. To describe the earth’s motion, the convention is to\n",
    "choose the earth’s semi-major axis as the unit of length, called “astronomical unit” (AU) and is $$1\\,AU=1.496 \\times 10^{11}\\,m.$$ The unit of time is taken to be “one year”, or $3.15 \\times 10^7$ s. In these units, $T=1$ yr, $a=1$ AU, and we can write $$GM=\\frac{4\\pi ^2a^3}{T^2}=4\\pi ^2 \\,AU^3/yr^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation of an Orbit \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the class `Particle2D` to simulate a circular orbit. In our simulations, we'll take the initial conditions (in astronomical units) $x_0=1$, $y_0=0$ and $v_x(t=0)=0$. We must choose a value of $\\Delta t$ such that to a good approximation the total energy $E$ is conserved. Then we have to ask ourselves, \"is your value of $\\Delta t$ small enough to reproduce the orbit over several periods?\"\n",
